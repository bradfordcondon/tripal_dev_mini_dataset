# Publishing MRNA

When we publish data in Tripal, we are creating entities for records in the chado database. The process is relatively simple.

From the admin menu, navigate to **Content > Tripal Content > Publish Tripal Content.**

Select mRNA from the **Content Type** dropdown and click **Publish.** A green header should appear with a job for you to run. Run the job and you're done.

You can check to make sure that publishing was successful by navigating to Content > Tripal Content. You can sort by Content Type > mRNA to display only the published mRNA results.
